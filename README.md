## What Are Git Worktrees?

Git worktrees allow you to check out multiple branches of the same repository simultaneously in different directories. This enables you to:

- Work on a feature while quickly switching to fix a bug
- Review pull requests without disrupting your current work
- Run tests on different branches in parallel
- Compare implementations across branches side-by-side
